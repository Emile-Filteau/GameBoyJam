# GameBoy Jam 2014 #

During the game boy jam 2014, we had to make a game in 48 hours.
The constraint where :
* Gameboy themed game
* All assets must be created during the jam
* 160px / 144px
* Maximum 4 colors

I added stuff after the jam because the game was fun.

I am currently redoing it from scratch in python [here](https://github.com/Emile-Filteau/RedneckDeerHunting)
